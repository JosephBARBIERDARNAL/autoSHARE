> *"The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) is a research infrastructure for studying the effects of health, social, economic and environmental policies over the life-course of European citizens and beyond"*

Key numbers:

- 530000 interviews
- 28 countries
- almost 4000 publications

## Motivation

We (autoSHARE's developers) believe that SHARE contains a wealth of information that can be used to answer a wide range of research/policy/clinical questions. However, we also believe that the complexity of SHARE data can be a barrier for many potential users. This is why we developed **autoSHARE**. We also believe that technical problems should not restrein the use of SHARE data, and that technology makes science more efficient, transparent and reproducible.

## What autoSHARE does

autoSHARE provides a user-friendly interface to manipulate, clean and analyze SHARE data. It is designed to make reproducible research easier, and to facilitate the use of SHARE data for a wide range of users.

This project is a PoC (Proof of Concept) and is still in development. Our goal is to create a tool able to:

- Load SHARE data, for one or multiple waves
- Clean and harmonize SHARE data
- Manage missing values with different methods
- Manage outliers with different methods
- Visualize data with interactive widgets
- Perform statistical modeling
- Save, export and share results easily

## How autoSHARE works

autoSHARE uses the `streamlit` library for the user interface, and other Python packages that you can find [here](https://github.com/JosephBARBIERDARNAL/autoSHARE/blob/main/requirements.txt).

A more in-depth explanation of the code can be found [on the main page](index.md).
