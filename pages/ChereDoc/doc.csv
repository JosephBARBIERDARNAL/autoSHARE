in the past years, many participants of share allowed us to take physical health measurements like their grip and lung strength. this year, to more precisely assess
disease risk, we would like to collect a few blood drops using just a finger prick as it is done daily by millions of diabetic people. we would be very grateful if you would
agree to participate. this is an important part of the study, as the analysis of blood samples will tell us a lot about the health of the population. i will explain more to you
about it. yet, this measurement is absolutely voluntary. if you do not wish to have your finger pricked, we will leave it out and continue the interview without the biomedical
part.
before we begin, i would like to have you read and sign this consent form.

please look at card 26.
have you received income from any of these sources in the year ^fllastyear;?
code all that apply.; main public sickness benefits: they are contribution-based payments received as an earnings replacement
when an employee is off sick.
main public disability insurance pension: if the sickness turns out to be long-standing, and a return to work is not to be
expected, then the claimant will typically be transferred to a disability insurance pension (e.g. invalidity or incapacity benefit).
the term 'pension' in the heading of this category is to be meant as 'regular payment', rather than relating to old age.
public unemployment benefit or insurance: they are received, for a limited time period, by previous employees, later finding
themselves unemployed. eligibility is based on a history of insurance contribution.
public long-term care insurance: it includes cash payments meant to provide for long term care needs; receipt does not
necessarily depend on having previously paid contributions.
social assistance: it includes cash or voucher programmes meant to provide a general 'safety net', guaranteeing minimum
resources to those otherwise lacking resources from either employment or contributory based social security benefits/pensions.

main public sickness benefits: they are contribution-based payments received as an earnings replacementwhen an employee is off sick.
main public disability insurance pension: if the sickness turns out to be long-standing, and a return to work is
not to be expected, then the claimant will typically be transferred to a disability insurance pension (e.g.invalidity or incapacity benefit). the term 'pension' in the heading of this category is to be meant as 'regularpayment', rather than relating to old age.
public unemployment benefit or insurance: they are received, for a limited time period, by previous employees,
later finding themselves unemployed. eligibility is based on a history of insurance contribution.
public long-term care insurance: it includes cash payments meant to provide for long term care needs; receipt
does not necessarily depend on having previously paid contributions.routing http://share-project.uvt.nl/share/version6.3/countries/generic (english)...

share 2004 questionnaire version 10 (manually edited april 2005)


preface

this generic paper version of the share -questionnaire is edited manually. therefore
it is more ‘user-friendly ’ than the automatically generated paper versions for each of
the pa rticipating coun tries.

this main part of the share 2004 questionnaire is asked to all eligible individuals in
a household , who have been identified in the introductory coverscreen module ( cv;
see share 2004 coverscreen version 10 ). however, s ome modules c oncerning the
household rather than the individual are only answered by the designated financial,
family, or housing respondent .

all variable names in this paper version are highlighted using bold characters and are
followed by the variable label (e.g. cv004_  first name respondent) . in
general, the variable names and labels in this paper version of the questionnaire are
similar to the variable names and labels used in the data set.

local currencies and pre -euro currency variables are converted into euro v alues in
the data set and stored with the separation identifier ‘_ ’ in the variable name replaced
by ‘e’. for unfolding bracket variables ‘_ ’ is replaced by ‘ ub’ and bracket values are
stored in variables using ‘v’ instead of ‘_ ’.

dummy variables have be en generated for each option of a multiple answer question,
with ‘d’ instead of the separator ‘_ ’. the number of the answer category is indicated
by the last number of the respective dummy variable’s name.

all conditions ( if statements ) are in capital le tters and italics. the pipelines on
the left hand side provide information about the number of applying conditions.


please consult the share data dissemination site for m ore detailed information
on the construction of the data set , the definition of variables, etc.

ep303_ intro (introduction income from public pensions )
now we are going to ask you a set of questions regarding income from different public pensions and benefits. we are interested in
the amounts, timing of these payments, and finally for how long you have received them.
1. continue
ep671_ incomesources (income from public pensions in last year )
please look at card 26.
have you received income from any of these sources in the year ^fllastyear;?
main public sickness benefits: they are contribution-based payments received as an earnings replacement when an employee is
off sick.
main public disability insurance pension: if the sickness turns out to be long-standing, and a return to work is not to be expected,
then the claimant will typically be transferred to a disability insurance pension (e.g. invalidity or incapacity benefit). the term
'pension' in the heading of this category is to be meant as 'regular payment', rather than relating to old age.
public unemployment benefit or insurance: they are received, for a limited time period, by previous employees, later finding
themselves unemployed. eligibility is based on a history of insurance contribution.
public long-term care insurance: it includes cash payments meant to provide for long term care needs; receipt does not
necessarily depend on having previously paid contributions.
social assistance: it includes cash or voucher programmes meant to provide a general 'safety net', guaranteeing minimum
resources to those otherwise lacking resources from either employment or contributory based social security benefits/pensions.

a small activity meter for 8 days. the meter is small and is worn on the upper leg. we will not be able to track your
location while you are wearing it, we only measure your movements. i will show you what it looks like now. you can attach
it very easily to your upper thigh with a tape. it is similar to using a band-aid.

your every day life. the motion measures are downloaded by us from the meter and are processed in an anonymized
format. i emphasize that participation in this measurement is fully voluntary.

ax009_ workorhobby (refusal conversion work or hobby )
i understand that you consider the device to be limiting in pursuing your work or hobbies. the device is very
small, lightweight, and easy to wear. you do not have to worry about it during your daily activities. you don't
have to turn it on or off, it works by itself. most people who wear it almost forget they are wearing it.
would you now be willing to participate in this special measurement?
1. yes
5. no
ax010_ absence (refusal conversion absence )
you indicated that you will be absent for a longer time. you only have to wear the accelerometer for 8
consecutive days. only if you will be absent all the time until june 2020 you cannot participate. if you will be
absent for a few weeks, for example for holidays or work, we can take that into account and send you the
accelerometer in another week.
would you now be willing to participate in this special measurement?
1. yes

ax011_ noburden (refusal conversion no burden )
i understand that you consider participation too complicated or burdensome. the only thing you have to do is
to wear the accelerometer for 8 consecutive days. it is very small and lightweight, easy to attach, and you do
not have to worry about it. you don´t have to turn it on or off, or do anything else with it during the wear, it
works by itself. most people who wear it almost forget they are wearing it. after the 8 days, you can simply
return it to us in the envelop that comes with it. you will get [country incentive] for your participation.
would you now be willing to participate in this special measurement?
1. yes
5. no
ax012_ privacy (refusal conversion privacy )
if i understand correctly, you think that wearing the device would give access to your private and sensitive
data. the device is not gps-enabled, your exact location cannot be recorded. the device simply measures the
number and intensity of your movements and nothing else. there is no possibility to track your whereabouts
or to measure any other information.
would you now be willing to participate in this special measurement?
1. yes
5. no
ax013_ skin (refusal conversion skin )
if i understand correctly, you think the tape with which you attach the device will damage your skin or
provoke an allergic reaction. the tape is specially designed for longer weartime on the skin. it is used for
medical purposes where people have to wear devices directly on the skin for a longer period than eight days.
the risk of an allergic reaction is therefore very small.

thank you. i will contact you again when your participation will start. we have a limited number of activity meters
available, so it is possible that we cannot provide one to everyone within the fieldwork period. if you are one of the
persons who do get one, you will receive the meter by post and i will contact you again. please be aware that it
might take several weeks until you receive a device and get contacted by me again. when you receive a device,
please make sure to start wearing it as soon as possible.
